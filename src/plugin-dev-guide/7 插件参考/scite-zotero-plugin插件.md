scite-zotero-plugin插件

[插件官网](https://github.com/scitedotai/scite-zotero-plugin)

# 插件说明

This is a Zotero plugin developed by [scite](https://scite.ai/) so that you can enrich your library with information from us.

It currently lets you do two main things:

- See classification tallies for each paper based on our Smart Citation data
- Easily go to the scite report page (see below)

### Smart Citation Classification Tallies

Once you install the plugin (see below section for instructions), each row will have columns for Supporting, Mentioning, and Contrasting. The values in this cell tell you, for a given paper, how many citations there are in the scite database with the corresponding classification.

For example, here, the paper titled Race, Breast Cancer Subtypes, and Survival in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study has received 228 supporting citations, 41 contrasting citations, and 2,481 mentioning citations from other publications in our database.

You can also sort on any of these 3 columns to see which papers are the most supported, contrasted, and so on.

These values will always be refreshed on launch, but you can refresh them individually by right-clicking on a row and selecting Refresh tallies from scite.

### Viewing a scite report

In order to explore the citation snippets around these classifications, you can view the scite report for the paper of interest. Simply right click a row and select View scite report. It should open the URL directly in your browser.

## Installation

Get the XPI file from https://github.com/scitedotai/scite-zotero-plugin/releases and install it in Zotero following the normal plugin procedure.

To install a plugin in Zotero, download its .xpi file to your computer. Then, in Zotero, click “Tools → Add-Ons”, then drag the .xpi for the plugin onto the Add-Ons window that opens.
